# Autonomous JetsonNano CarProject
This Project Involves a Jetson Nano, paired to an Arduino, DC Motors, Motor Controllers, Sensors, Camera and External Power to create an autonomous electric car 
# Program List
#### Roam Mode: *car will move autonomously
#### Follow Mode:
#### Track
#### Create Mode
# Essential Parts List:
#### Many of these parts can be exchanged for cheaper alternatives, but this is what I used for my project.
